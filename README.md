# deepsignnet_v2
Version 2 of System Prototype for the DeepSignNet Project

This github repository entails the second version of the automated sign language recongnition system.
The prototype is developed using the Django web framework under the Docker Operating system virtualization for efficient continuous development andintegration. 
The machine learning counterpart of the system architecture is developed under the PyTorch library with GPU computational resources used for optimized inference speed.
